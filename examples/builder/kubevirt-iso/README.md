### Example Usage

> ðŸ’¡ Ensure you are logged in to the Kubernetes cluster and that KubeVirt is installed.

Change to the directory that contains the relevant files, and then run:

```shell
# Export variable below that is used by the Packer builder
$ export KUBECONFIG=~/.kube/config

# Deploy a DataVolume to import the ISO to the Kubernetes cluster
$ kubectl apply -f ${ISO_NAME}.yaml

# Run the Packer builder
$ packer build ${TEMPLATE_NAME}.pkr.hcl
```

**Note**: Ensure you have deployed everything in the same Kubernetes namespace.
